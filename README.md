# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview 
* the pupose of this analysis was to look at and try to predict credit risk on loans. Because of the multitude of variables that go into accessing ones credit we used more then one machine learning model such as undersampling, oversampling, and a mix of both to predict credit risk. The goal was to find the model or combination of models that best predicted credit risk. 

## Results 
#### EasyEnsambleClassifier

# Summary
* Throughout this analysis multiple methods were used to analyze credit risk, one of the top performing methods was the EasyEnsamble Classifier. This method was able to classify the highest percentage of accurate cases, while also being able to accurately identify the high risk cases. After this analysis the front runner for perfomring these types of analysis most accurately should be the EasyEnsambleClassifier.
